For the next few weeks, I will try out this workout routine I concocted
from various sources (mostly 
[r/bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/)). 
Might add images for unusual/complicated exercises.

The routine is made up of daily flexibility work
plus alternating strength and skill days.
Warm-ups differ depending on the day.
Skill and flexibility days are technically rest days.

## Strength work
### Warm-up
