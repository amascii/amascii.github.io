Finally taking the time to learn how to blog with Jekyll. It's incredibly easy! I really should have done this sooner.

Now, I say "site revamp" but really I just mean there will actually be content here. 
Thanks to this recent coronavirus epidemic (and being in my senior year with barely any classes), I have a lot of free time on my hands.

This blog serves two purposes: logging and accountability. 
Logging, so I can remember some of the things I've done. 
Accountability, so I can feel slightly more pressured to get things done (I mustn't make my readers wait!).

I plan to talk about many topics that interest me: music, books, computer science, food, travel, and whatever else may come along.
Listy topics will have dedicated sections (like the [Library](/library/): a list of books I've read since 2020).
Not so listy topics will most likely be stand-alone blog posts (with appropiate tags of course).

As they say in Japan, よろしくお願いします!
