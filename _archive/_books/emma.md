## Volume I
<details>
    <summary>Summary</summary>
    Emma befriends Harriet, a naive girl whom she admires for her 
    simplicity and wife-ability. 
    Harriet's claims are, due to her unknown parents, non-existant; 
    however, Emma believes she is entitled to more 
    (simply on account of her manners and beauty) 
    and tries to match her with someone that will
    elevate her so. She fixates on Mr. Elton, bringing the two together
    as often as possible. Mr. Elton has other plans; on the way home from
    Christmas at Randalls', he confesses his love to Emma, thereby 
    upsetting her original plan. She reflects on her grand matchmaking
    mistake, and her error in jumping to conlusions. Harriet, of course, is
    heartbroken, but distancing and time will heal her wounds.

- Why Emma won't be just some old maid:
> ... 
it is poverty only which makes celibacy
contemptible to a generous public! ...

- Ironic foreshadowing:
> ... and she walked on, amusing herself in the consideration of 
the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge 
of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high pretensions
to judgement are for ever falling into... 

- Guiltiness after breaking the bad news to Harriet:
> ... the sight of Harriet's tears made her think that she should 
never be in charity with herself again.

## Volume II
<details>
    <summary>Summary</summary>
    Frank and Jane join the cast. Frank seems to be ideal; Emma 
    almost falls for him but stops herself just in time.
    Jane is what Emma would be if she weren't so vain and had no money.

- How she justifies Frank's impromptu haircut:
> ... but folly is not always folly.

## Volume III
<details>
    <summary>Summary</summary>
    Emma forms a new match in her mind: Frank and Harriet. 
    However, she resolves on keeping it to herself and not interfering at
    all (<em>shipping</em>, basically). 
    Unsuspected by everyone, a secret engagement between 
    Frank and Jane is discovered. Turns out, Harriet has a crush
    on Mr. Knightley; again Emma failed to correctly judge the situation.
    Emma is in despair, for she finally realizes she has always
    loved him. She does nothing thinking that interfering is not in
    her right, but the matter is resolved soon enough
    when Mr. Knightley confesses <em>his</em> love for Emma.

- Anagnorisis:
> With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of
every body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange 
every body's destiny.
