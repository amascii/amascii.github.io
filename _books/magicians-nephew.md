I've read this book three or four times now. 
It's easily my favorite from *The Chronicles Of Narnia*.
Favorite chapters include "The Wood Between the Worlds" and 
"The Bell and the Hammer". 
I just love that other-worldly/multi-verse vibe it has going on.
The excitement of being in an unexplored place and the
fear of never getting home make me feel pleasantly queasy.
