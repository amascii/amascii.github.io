    I've read this book three or four times now. 
    It's easily my favorite from *The Chronicles Of Narnia*. 
    Favorite chapters include "The Wood Between the Worlds" and "The Bell and the Hammer". 
    I just love that other-worldly/multi-verse vibe it has going on. 
    The excitement of being in an unexplored place and the fear of never getting home make me feel pleasantly queasy.
